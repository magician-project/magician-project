# Code of Conduct

Each repository within the GitHub organisation shall belong to one team (i.e., a partner of the consortium).
Such team is the main responsible for carry out the development of the associated code.

All partners can contribute to any repository, however to ensure that changes are properly handled and reviewed by the *owning* team, please follow standard collaboration practices.
In particular, we recommend working on a separate branch and submitting a pull request to the main branch of the repository, so that the team can review the changes before merging them.

If you find some bugs, or you request some new features/changes, the best way to proceed is to open a new issue in the repository. 
If you don't know in which repository to open the issue, create one within [this repository](https://github.com/magician-project/), and make sure to ping all relevant teams.



## Notes for administrators

Make sure that for the repositories belonging to your team, all the team members have write access to the repository.
